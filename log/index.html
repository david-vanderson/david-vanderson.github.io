But sdl can’t read from a “Normal”, and dx11 can’t draw from a “Target”.</p><p>Generally the type you get from the backend is the same, but there is a bit of state associated with it.  We could have done the same:</p><pre><code>pub const Texture = struct {
    is_target: bool,
</code></pre><p>But then we have to check that field (easy to mess up), and have a way to notify developers if they used the wrong kind in the wrong place.</p><h4>Type-based Intent</h4><p>We are now putting that bit of state into the type:</p><pre><code>// this is always &quot;normal&quot;
pub const Texture = struct { ... };

// this is always &quot;target&quot;
pub const TextureTarget = struct { ... };
</code></pre><p>Now you get a compile error when trying to use the wrong one in the wrong place.  Great!</p></div><div id="2025-04-01"><h2><a class="" href="#2025-04-01">March 2025</a></h2><p>dvui got a bunch of new stuff this month:</p><ul><li>combobox (combines textEntry and dropdown)</li><li>suggestions (choices that show dynamically under a textEntry)</li><li>tooltips</li><li>web file upload</li><li>simple plots</li><li>kerning</li><li>horizontal mouse wheel support</li></ul><p>Plus a whole ton of minor fixes and enhancements.</p><p>We had 6 people contribute code this month!</p><p>Thank you to everyone who asked questions, filed issues, and contributed!</p></div><div id="2025-03-11"><h2><a class="" href="#2025-03-11">double click, long tap, and friction</a></h2><p>dvui does not currently have built-in support for double-click, double-tap, or long-tap.  My current thinking is that those interaction patterns are generally worse than the alternatives.</p><p>The general advantage of these is to have a second way to interact with a widget besides a normal click/tap.  Otherwise you need a separate widget, or the widget be modal, or change depending on zoom level, or some other redesign.</p><p>The downsides are poor discoverability and accessibility.  I’ve personally had the experience of trying to double-click or long-tap something, nothing happens, and I’m left unsure if it doesn’t exist or if I did the interaction wrong.</p><p>I’ve watched people with slight hand shakiness try to long-tap repeatedly but only ever get a touch-drag.</p><p>This is why dvui’s textLayout and textEntry widgets provide a modal touch interface.  A single tap transitions between normal mode and selection mode.</p><p>They do have mouse-only 2-click word select and 3-click line select.  Those are features that are useful to some while not requiring use by all.</p><h4>How much should my opinions shape dvui’s design?</h4><p>On one hand dvui must serve its users (developers) in providing the UI features they need and want.</p><p>On the other hand dvui should serve its users by making it easier to build good UIs than bad ones.  Nobody wants a button that by default only responds to a triple-click.</p><p>My strategy is to make requested features possible, but use my experience to guide developers by making some features easier to use than others.</p><p>We see a similar strategy in Zig design, where the core team uses “friction” to guide developers - some patterns are intentionally left more awkward to use than others to discorage their use while not preventing it outright.</p></div><div id="2025-02-23"><h2><a class="" href="#2025-02-23">min_size_content is not the minimum</a></h2><p>If the parent does not have enough space, child widgets get less than their min size.</p><p>What about <strong>max_size_content</strong> - can a widget get more?</p><p>Yes - if that widget is expanded, it can be larger than max_size_content.</p><p><strong>min_size_content</strong> and <strong>max_size_content</strong> are both constraints imposed on the minimum size that dvui saves for each widget from frame to frame.</p></div><div id="2025-02-22"><h2><a class="" href="#2025-02-22">Why min_size_content?</a></h2><p>To make it clear that padding/border/margin is added on top of that.</p><p>Why not just <strong>min_size</strong>?</p><p>This is an example of naming tension in API design.</p><p>When you want a widget to be larger than its minimum size (but not expanded):</p><pre><code>.{ .min_size_content = .{ .w = 100, .h = 50 } }
</code></pre><p>We could make it shorter and easier to remember by using just <strong>min_size</strong>, but then you have to remember (or lookup) if that already includes padding/border/margin.</p><p>So <strong>min_size_content</strong> costs more characters but makes reading the code (especially for people new to DVUI) slightly easier.</p><p>Hard to know which way to go, but I think about stuff like this a lot.</p></div></div>
