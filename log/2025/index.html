      <h2><a href="#2025-06-24">Live Resize on Windows and Mac
</a></h2>
      <p>We all want our applications to repaint smoothly while the OS window is being resized.</p><p>Unfortunately Windows and Mac make this difficult.  The normal event loop is suspended during the entire resize.</p><p>This meant during the resize you saw:</p><ul><li>Windows: frozen last frame maybe cropped or with additional space</li><li>Mac: frozen last frame stretched/squashed to fit</li></ul><p>The underlying problem on both platforms is that they run a nested event loop during the resize, so we lose control.</p><p>There seem to be 2 solutions:</p><ul><li>implement callbacks - render a new frame in the callback</li><li>use multiple threads - render in a separate thread and coordinate</li></ul><p>We now use the callback solution by default in the <strong>SDL3 backend if you are using dvui.App</strong> (so already using callbacks).</p><p>This works, you can see the content reflow while resizing!</p><p>But it is not perfect:</p><ul><li>Windows: it causes a delay when dragging the OS window around by the window title bar</li><li>Mac: resizing introduces some jitter in the sizing of the OS window</li><li>While enabled by default, it can be disabled by <code>-Dsdl3-callbacks=false</code>.</li></ul><p>As best I can tell, to improve on this you have to use multiple threads and put a lot of bespoke code in.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-06-17">Removing Errors From Most Functions
</a></h2>
      <p>Teodor Källman has successfully removed errors from almost all dvui functions.  Horay!</p><p>Now dvui handles most errors internally:</p><ul><li>If the high level API failes to allocate space for a widget, we panic.<ul><li>The alternative is to allocate the widget on the stack, but it is unclear how that would be better.</li></ul></li><li>If a widget gets an error while rendering, it logs it and continues.</li><li>If a widget gets an allocation error internally (like a label format that goes bad), it logs it and continues.</li></ul><p>Some functions like <code>textureCreate()</code> can still fail.</p><p>Up to this point we hadn’t spent much time thinking about errors.  Everybody (that I saw) put <code>try</code> in front of all dvui functions, and any error took down the whole app.</p><p>Now dvui is aiming to be more robust to errors, especially cases under end-user control.</p><p>For example, if your gui shows user-controlled text or graphs user data, then we’d like for dvui to not crash if the user tries to show way too much text/info.  Ideally dvui continues running and shows some visual indication that something is wrong, allowing the user to get back out of the situation.</p><p>This is the first big push in that direction, and we’ll continue to refine how we handle errors going forward.</p><p>If you have an application where dvui error handling is causing problems, I want to know!  Please file an issue.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-06-04">Raylib Variable Framerate
</a></h2>
      <p>@sooriya on discord recently asked if we could do variable framerate on raylib, and now we can!</p><p>For waiting on an event without any timeout, raylib already had the necessary pieces with EnableEventWaiting().</p><p>For waiting with a timeout, I submitted a proposal PR to raylib, but it was turned down.  So for that we are assuming that raylib is using glfw and we are directly calling glfwWaitEventsTimeout().</p><p>You can get this either by using dvui.App or copying the relevant parts from the updated examples/raylib-standalone.zig.</p><p>It’s not perfect:</p><ul><li>glfwWaitEventsTimeout() doesn’t tell us if it was interrupted or not</li><li>if an event comes between EndDrawing() and glfwWaitEventsTimeout() we will wait anyway</li></ul><p>But it’s good enough for applications that don’t want to peg the cpu.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-05-12">Taking Units Seriously
</a></h2>
      <p>DVUI’s main geometry struct is a <code>Rect</code> (rectangle with x,y and width/height).  But what are the units?</p><p>We have 3 common units:</p><ul><li>Physical Pixels<ul><li>1-to-1 with screen/output pixels</li><li>dvui events and drawing use this</li></ul></li><li>Natural Pixels<ul><li>approximately 72 per inch</li><li>will be different from Physical on hidpi screens</li><li>modified by content scaling</li><li>dvui floating windows/widgets use this</li><li>OS events generally use this</li></ul></li><li>Logical Pixels<ul><li>local coordinates possibly modified by parent widgets</li><li>ScaleWidget changes this</li><li>normal widgets use this</li></ul></li></ul><p>For example, you might specify a <code>textEntry</code> with a font that is 16px tall and <code>.min_content_size = .{ .w = 100 }</code>.  Those are logical pixels, so they mean something together, but don’t say anything about how large it will be on the screen.</p><p>To convert, widgets call <code>WidgetData.rectScale()</code> (or similar) which calls <code>parent.screenRectScale()</code> to get a <code>RectScale</code>.  That is a physical rect plus a scale, and represents a rectangle of screen pixels and the scale factor between logical and physical pixels.</p><p>From the beginning we’ve had a steady stream of units errors because the units were implicit.</p><h4>Making Units Explicit</h4><p>We’re trying out adding units to the types.  Now we have:</p><ul><li>Rect (Logical)</li><li>Rect.Physical</li><li>Rect.Natural</li></ul><p>For example <code>RectScale.rectToPhysical()</code> converts from a (logical) Rect to Rect.Physical.  <code>Rect.scale()</code> now requires a unit type representing the units being converted to.</p><p>The drawing functions all take Rect.Physical, and the floating functions take Rect.Natural, hopefully making most units errors into compile errors.</p><p>This has already caught a few bugs, and I’m hoping it helps going forward.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-04-30">type-based intent
</a></h2>
      <p>We recently split <code>Texture</code> into two types: <code>Texture</code> and <code>TextureTarget</code>.</p><p>Both have the same fields (pointer, width, height), so what gives?</p><p>Backends make two varieties of textures:  “Normal” ones that are drawn <strong>from</strong>, and “Target” ones that are drawn <strong>to</strong>.</p><p>Some backends (web, raylib) treat these interchangeably.  But sdl can’t read from a “Normal”, and dx11 can’t draw from a “Target”.</p><p>Generally the type you get from the backend is the same, but there is a bit of state associated with it.  We could have done the same:</p><pre><code>pub const Texture = struct {
    is_target: bool,
</code></pre><p>But then we have to check that field (easy to mess up), and have a way to notify developers if they used the wrong kind in the wrong place.</p><h4>Type-based Intent</h4><p>We are now putting that bit of state into the type:</p><pre><code>// this is always &quot;normal&quot;
pub const Texture = struct { ... };

// this is always &quot;target&quot;
pub const TextureTarget = struct { ... };
</code></pre><p>Now you get a compile error when trying to use the wrong one in the wrong place.  Great!</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-03-11">double click, long tap, and friction
</a></h2>
      <p>dvui does not currently have built-in support for double-click, double-tap, or long-tap.  My current thinking is that those interaction patterns are generally worse than the alternatives.</p><p>The general advantage of these is to have a second way to interact with a widget besides a normal click/tap.  Otherwise you need a separate widget, or the widget be modal, or change depending on zoom level, or some other redesign.</p><p>The downsides are poor discoverability and accessibility.  I’ve personally had the experience of trying to double-click or long-tap something, nothing happens, and I’m left unsure if it doesn’t exist or if I did the interaction wrong.</p><p>I’ve watched people with slight hand shakiness try to long-tap repeatedly but only ever get a touch-drag.</p><p>This is why dvui’s textLayout and textEntry widgets provide a modal touch interface.  A single tap transitions between normal mode and selection mode.</p><p>They do have mouse-only 2-click word select and 3-click line select.  Those are features that are useful to some while not requiring use by all.</p><h4>How much should my opinions shape dvui’s design?</h4><p>On one hand dvui must serve its users (developers) in providing the UI features they need and want.</p><p>On the other hand dvui should serve its users by making it easier to build good UIs than bad ones.  Nobody wants a button that by default only responds to a triple-click.</p><p>My strategy is to make requested features possible, but use my experience to guide developers by making some features easier to use than others.</p><p>We see a similar strategy in Zig design, where the core team uses “friction” to guide developers - some patterns are intentionally left more awkward to use than others to discorage their use while not preventing it outright.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-02-23">min_size_content is not the minimum
</a></h2>
      <p>If the parent does not have enough space, child widgets get less than their min size.</p><p>What about <strong>max_size_content</strong> - can a widget get more?</p><p>Yes - if that widget is expanded, it can be larger than max_size_content.</p><p><strong>min_size_content</strong> and <strong>max_size_content</strong> are both constraints imposed on the minimum size that dvui saves for each widget from frame to frame.</p>

      <h2><a href="#2025-02-22">Why min_size_content?
</a></h2>
      <p>To make it clear that padding/border/margin is added on top of that.</p><p>Why not just <strong>min_size</strong>?</p><p>This is an example of naming tension in API design.</p><p>When you want a widget to be larger than its minimum size (but not expanded):</p><pre><code>.{ .min_size_content = .{ .w = 100, .h = 50 } }
</code></pre><p>We could make it shorter and easier to remember by using just <strong>min_size</strong>, but then you have to remember (or lookup) if that already includes padding/border/margin.</p><p>So <strong>min_size_content</strong> costs more characters but makes reading the code (especially for people new to DVUI) slightly easier.</p><p>Hard to know which way to go, but I think about stuff like this a lot.</p>
